# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
Module 12 Ploty &amp; Belly Button Biodiversity

The Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard adds visualization to the belly button data. Roza's volunteers need to be able to indentify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. Improbable Beef may identify a belly button species in their synthetic beef. The volunteers can then check to see if the specifies is found in their navel.

This dashboard is interactive and updates as the ID number is changed.
